# weather-app2

This is my Calender Application. It was a project given to us in our coding bootcamp. It was built to help a user schedule their day and to stay more organized. It could help the user with many aspects of life whether that be work, school or even help the user keep up with their families day to day activities by knowing what to expect from the weather. There is a current feature. Also, a five day forecast to help you plan your week!

This project challenged every bit of coding knowledge(which isn't much). Im learning to be patient and not to wait so long before asking for help. I most certainly learned a good amount with javascript. My project is mine because of the color pallet.

Make sure to check out the local storage that is saved to the home page after a search is entered.

When you open the page just enter a city in the search bar. You can either hit enter or click on the magnifying glass icon to begin your search. You will find a current weather condition card and a 5 day forecast. These cards will be displaying temperature, humidity and wind speed. You will also notice the icon on the card to help you visualize what it is like outside.
